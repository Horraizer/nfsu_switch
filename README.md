# nfsu-switch

Experimental clean-room engine research for Need for Speed: Underground.

The repository contains no Electronic Arts code or game data. A user-provided
PC installation is required for local research and testing.

## Current milestone

The first milestone is `nfsu_probe`, a read-only installation and chunk-format
inspector. It validates the expected game layout and walks NFS chunk containers
without loading whole asset files into memory.

## Build

```text
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Run

```text
build/nfsu_probe summary X:/Games/NFSU
build/nfsu_probe chunks X:/Games/NFSU/Cars/240SX/GEOMETRY.BIN 64
build/nfsu_probe meshes X:/Games/NFSU/Cars/240SX/GEOMETRY.BIN
build/nfsu_probe obj X:/Games/NFSU/Cars/240SX/GEOMETRY.BIN build/240sx.obj
```

`meshes` lists every mesh with its name, vertex count, face count and
validation status. `obj` writes all valid meshes to a diagnostic OBJ file at
the given path. Both commands print precise diagnostics for malformed meshes
and exit with status 3 if any issue was found. See `docs/FORMATS.md` for the
decoded layout and the exact OBJ axis and winding conventions.

All commands are read-only with respect to the game installation. Do not
commit exported meshes; they are derived from copyrighted game data.

## Project direction

1. Validate retail PC data and document chunk layouts.
2. Decode one car geometry and texture set.
3. Render the car in a portable desktop reference application.
4. Load one track region and add camera and collision tests.
5. Add a Nintendo Switch platform backend using libnx and deko3d.
